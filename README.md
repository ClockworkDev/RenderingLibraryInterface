# Clockwork Rendering Library Interface
This repo is the starting point for writing your own rendering library for Clockwork, there are two ways of doing so:

  - Using the vainilla JavaScript template (renderingLibraryTemplate.js), you just need to fill the empty methods with your own logic
  - Writing a TypeScript class that implements the interface provided in renderingLibraryInterface.ts
